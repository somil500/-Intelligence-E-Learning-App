# 🧠 Intelligent Course-Based Application (Frontend Demo)

## Project Overview

This is a **frontend-only demonstration** of an interactive e-learning platform. It showcases a modern UI/UX design, user authentication flow (login/signup), course enrollment, progress tracking, and a simple quiz mechanism.

**Key Feature:** All data (users, enrollments, and scores) is persisted locally using the browser's **`localStorage`**. This allows you to test the full sign-up and progress features without needing a backend server, but the data will be tied to the specific browser you use.

## 🚀 Features

* **Authentication Flow (Demo):** Simple Login and Signup functionality.
* **Course Catalog:** Display of 23 different technical and soft skill courses.
* **Enrollment:** Users can enroll in courses to unlock content and quizzes.
* **Progress Tracking:** Shows user progress based on quiz performance in the sidebar.
* **Performance Quizzes:** Interactive multiple-choice quizzes for enrolled courses with scoring.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Built purely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
